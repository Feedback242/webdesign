    <p style="font-size: 25px; margin: 50px; margin-left: 300px; margin-right: 300px; font-family: monospace">Hello there! We are very happy you have visited our website and would love to share a bit more about the story and motivation behind creating this site. Our main themes are Food, Vegan Food and Marburg. Let us tell you more about how these three come together!

        <br><br>Well, first things first; we love food! More than just a delicious energy source we also think of it as a social ritual of sharing time and creating memories with friends and loved ones. Most first dates involve a nice dinner, when we want to celebrate a promotion at work, we invite our friends for a delicious meal and all major holidays revolve around cooking traditional dishes and visiting a new place while travelling also involves tasting the local cuisine. Food is powerful, it creates communities and tells powerful stories.
        Why vegan food? It may sound like we are simply following a trend and since none of us is strictly vegan or vegetarian, you may judge us as inauthentic. But, for us it is about providing people who follow a vegan, vegetarian, or gluten free diet all the information they need about a restaurant so that they can have a meal out without having to feel excluded or “othered”!

        <br><br>Our mission is not to teach you how to take care of your health or what to fuel your body with, our mission is to make following a certain diet more accessible and easier so that each can choose what is best for them without having to sacrifice what we feel is essential; sharing a meal with others!

        <br><br>That brings us to our third theme; Marburg. We both came here to study and fell in love with this city and its charm. An old town with such young and progressive energy and yet we found all existing guides are heavily focused on historical sites. We want to give you a new way of exploring it. Whether you are visiting Marburg as a tourist or are a new student here; Our restaurant reviews through the diet restriction lens are meant to help you get to know Marburg better and in a more interesting way.
